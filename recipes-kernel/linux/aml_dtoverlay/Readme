Note:
    In order to increase the function of deleting nodes, we added the "__removenode__" keyword, if you have the need to delete nodes, please refer to the following writing.
example:
=========================================================================================
    /dts-v1/;
    /plugin/;

    / {
        fragment@0 {
            target-path = "/partitions";  //Absolute path of the node to be deleted.
		    __removenode__ {              //"__removenode__" node needn't write anything inside.
		    };
        };
    };
==========================================================================================
